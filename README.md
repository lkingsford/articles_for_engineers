Technical articles
==================

Hello friends and nerds.

I was writing an article in markdown for Medium, and I thought that having it on
GitHub might be useful. I thought other devs might like a place to put up their
articles too.

If you'd like to share your articles too, make a Pull Request. Somebody will
review it, make suggestions if they're in a good mood, and it'll join the
currently limited number of articles here.

By default, any articles here are under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
Feel free to submit articles with any flavor of Creative Commons license, but
if you want a different license to CC BY-NC-SA, list it at the bottom of your
article.

Technically, please:

- Use GitHub flavored markdown
- Use a filename in the following format: `year-username_title-of-article.md`. Username can be your surname instead. Please keep the filename all lowercase, without spaces.
- If you've got external files (images, code snippets), put them in a folder with the same name as your article (without the .md extension). Make your references relative (so - like, `2020-lkingsford_my-article/graph.png`).
- Add it to the [index.md](index.md).

No exclusivity is required.
